#### Technologies
This project covers a large number of technologies. 

* *Java EE 7*. Java Enterprise Edition is the technology you will use to develop your application.
* *JPA*. The Java Persistence API provides a Java API onto your application's data.
* *JTA*. The Java Transaction API is a general API for managing transactions in Java. It allows you to start, commit and rollback transactions in a resource neutral way.
* *JSON*. This is the data serialization and interchange format used by Javascript and commonly returned by HTTP APIs.
* *Bean Validation*. This technology allows you to specify constraints on your data and assists with validation.
* *Arquillian*. With this tool you will be able to write tests that run inside the application server.
* *Maven*. Your application will be built and deployed with this tool.
* *OpenShift*. This is the Platform as a Service (PaaS) that you will use to deploy your application to the Cloud.
* *JAX-RS*. This technology provides the Java EE API for developing REST services. You will use this technology to communicate between distributed components of your application (web-interfaces & other services).
* *Git*. This is a distributed version control system and will be used to backup your code and for deploying it to OpenShift.
* *Swagger*. Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API. Using Java @Annotations Swagger will generate documentation for JAX-RS endpoints as part of the project build process.
